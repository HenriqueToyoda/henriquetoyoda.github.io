# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Henrique Madureira Toyoda

I am currently looking for new challenges within the C# and Dot net 6 programming language, having done some training and programs on top of these languages. I have been working as a systems analyst since 2017, starting as an intern in 2014 and moving on to the role of technician in 2015. My main responsibilities were developing solutions for ERP Protheus, knowing both its architecture and the best development practices in ADVPL, mapping solutions for payroll, electronic point and currently for passenger transport, in addition to being a disseminator of information within the team. In addition to knowledge in ADVPL, I have knowledge in Java and Python and I work with web programming with Angular and mobile with Ionic, more focused on Android. I currently carry out my work based on agile processes, focusing on Scrum concepts and having already worked with Kanban.
